Hi! I'm @JakePulitzer. 

I am interested in leveraging big data and analytics to drive informed business decisions.

I graduated from the Leeds School of Business at University of Colorado Boulder with a Master's of Science in Business Analytics and a focus in Marketing.  
I earned my Bachelor's of Science from CMCI at the University of Boulder Colorado, focusing on Advertising and Strategic Communications. 

In my free time you will find me fly fishing, skiing, and hiking right here in the beatuful rocky mountain. 

On my GitHub you will find analytics projects from my master's program along with some other personal projects I have been working on. 

Take a look and hope you enjoy! Also, any feedback is welcome. 

Chao!
